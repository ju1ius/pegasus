## Parser Combinators

* [ ] Error reporting
    * [x] Tracing
* [ ] Grammar composition
    * [ ] All (?) grammar transforms should apply to composed grammars:
        * Trace
        * Optimizations
* [ ] Grammar inheritance
* [ ] Error recovery
* [ ] CST decimation
* [ ] CST transforms
* [ ] Semantic actions
* [ ] Parametrized rules
* [ ] Lexical rules (whitespace handling)
* [ ] Profiling

## Optimizer

* [ ] Do not automatically remove unused rules,
        or add syntax to preserve alternative grammar entrypoints

## Compiler

* [ ] Import resolver
* [ ] Update runtime / templates

## Examples

* [ ] CSS selectors
* [ ] code cleanup

## Experiments

* [ ] investigate performance of throwing Exceptions for failures
