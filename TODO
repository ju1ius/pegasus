## Parser Combinators

* [ ] Error reporting
    * [x] Tracing
    * [ ] Find a way to avoid mutation of the grammar, i.e. :
        - Clone expressions in the visitor instead of the traverser
        - copy the original expression id to the new trace
        Problem is that this is not idempotent
* [x] Apply transforms to parent & traits:
    * [x] Trace
    * [x] Optimizations
* [ ] Grammar composition
* [ ] Grammar inheritance
* [ ] Error recovery
* [ ] CST decimation
* [ ] CST transforms
* [ ] Semantic actions
* [ ] Parametrized rules
* [ ] Lexical rules (w/ whitespace handling)
* [ ] Profiling

## Optimizer

* [ ] Do not automatically remove unused rules,
        or add syntax to preserve alternative grammar entrypoints

## Compiler

* [ ] Import resolver
* [ ] Update runtime / templates
* [ ] Investigate virtual machines

## Examples

* [ ] CSS selectors
* [ ] code cleanup

## Experiments

* [ ] investigate performance of throwing Exceptions for failures
